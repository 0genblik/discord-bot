"""
Entry Point Lambda Function for Discord Bot

This Lambda function serves as the primary entry point for all Discord interactions.
It implements Discord's Interactions architecture requirements:
1. Responds to PING requests (interaction_type 1) for endpoint validation
2. Handles command requests (interaction_type 2) by deferring to a second Lambda

Architecture Flow:
---------------
1. Discord -> API Gateway -> This Lambda
2. This Lambda validates the request signature
3. For commands: Triggers handle_command Lambda asynchronously

Why This Design?
--------------
Discord requires responses within 3 seconds. Some commands (like weather)
might take longer. We solve this by:
1. Immediately acknowledging receipt ("bot is thinking...")
2. Asynchronously triggering another Lambda for actual processing
This pattern is called "deferred response" in Discord terminology.

Security:
--------
Every Discord request includes:
- Request body
- Timestamp
- Ed25519 signature
We verify these using discord-interactions library to prevent forgery.

    1. Discord sends three key pieces:

       - Timestamp (when the request was sent)
       - Ed25519 signature (cryptographic proof)
       
    2. We verify these using Discord's public key to ensure:
       - Request really came from Discord
       - Request hasn't been tampered with
       - Request isn't too old (replay attack protection)

    Architecture Note:
    ----------------

    ---------
    - Discord needs a response in 3 seconds
